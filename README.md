## Priority queue
This is a technical task for the internship.

## Methods
* push(elem, pr) - add an element in queue according to its priority
* pop() - remove and return element with the lowest priority
* peek() - return element and its priority
* getCount() - return the number of elements in the queue

## Complexity
All methods have logarithmic time, except getCount(), which has constant time.
